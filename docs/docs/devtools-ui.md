The IMA.js devtools consist of 3 main windows - [Panel](/docs/devtools-ui#panel), [Popup](/docs/devtools-ui#popup)
and [Options](/docs/devtools-options). Each has some specific usage and
we're going to take a look at the first two in following sections.

## Panel

Main component of our IMA.js devtools is the panel window, that you get after opening Chrome devtools
(use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + Shift + J` on Windows or `Cmd + Option + J` on Mac)
and clicking on **IMA.js tab** on any IMA.js application website.

<div class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

This tab shows you all **events** (that you defined in the [options](/docs/devtools-options), which we'll talk about later) 
and **method calls** in your application since it's initialization. But there are few other components in this window,
that offers some additional functionality, so let's take a closer look at each of those.

### Search bar

<div class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui-search.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

The search bar allows you to **filter all messages** using simple **fuzzy search**. The keywords are currently
matched with `payload.label`, so searching for values in payloads or any other text, that is not
part of the `payload.label` will result in invalid search results (this may change in the future versions).

You can also use **JS regular expressions** for more advance filtering. To use these expressions, simply wrap
the searched string between `/(init)/i` backslashes. There's built in validation, where if the RegExp is not correct,
the input text will be red and no search is performed.

<div class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui-search-validation.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

#### Search action buttons

In the search bar, we can also find a group of four buttons. **First two buttons** are related to the currently selected
item and allows you to select one directly above or below it. These two buttons also have a key shortcuts
defined to **arrow up** and **arrow down**, so you can use these too.

The third one **clears the currently searched text** and
last one opens a menu, where additional two buttons let's you either **clear whole state** (e.g. all messages are deleted)
or access additional [options](/docs/devtools-options).

<div class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui-search-action-btns.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

### Messages view

<div class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui-message.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

This is probably the main part of whole devtools. Here you can see all events and methods
(that have registered hooks in the [options](/docs/devtools-options)) and time they were called
relative to the first event received.

The first label in each row corresponds to the `class` that was an origin of `method call`, that is displayed
right next to the class name on light background. Optionally on some events you can see `pending/resolved xms` tag.
This tag marks that some of the arguments of the method call are promises. The `pending/resolved` status
than corresponds to whenever all **promises** in the method call are resolved or not. The time in `ms` than displays
**time diff between first call the method and last resolved promise**.


### Data view

<div class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui-dataview.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

This view has 3 tabs - **Args**, **Payload** and **Events**. Args and Payload are basically shortcut to the last event's `payload.state` in the Events tab.
Each method call can have one or multiple events, this depends whenever any of the arguments is a promise or not. In case it is, the events is an array
where each new input corresponds to a resolved promise.

Each event has multiple arguments, where most of those are an internal arguments used in the devtools panel or to process the message. Most of the time
you're only interested in `args` and `payload` arguments in the `payload.state`. That's also why we have those two other tabs that are basically shortcuts
to these objects.

## Popup

<div style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;" class="image is-padded-with-shadow">
  <img src="{{ '/img/docs/devtools-ui-popup.png?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }}" />
</div>

The popup is a simple window that you can see after clicking on the IMA.js extension icon
in the chrome toolbar. The main purpose of this window is to give you quick toggle to **enable**
or **disable** the extension functionality = **injecting the scripts and creating devtools panel**.

>**Note:** due to limitations of chrome extension API, when you disable IMA.js extension through this
 popup, the detection and reload scripts are still getting injected to the page. Only thing
 that doesn't get injected is the devtool code itself, which wraps each class in a proxy like object
 that sends messages to our devtools panel. 
>
>So in case you have any issues with your application and you think it's caused by the devtools, you
>should completely disable the extension in order to prevent any possible side effects.
 

This popup can have **3 states**:
 - **Detecting** - you can get a glimpse of this state when you reload the page while the popup is opened
 and the devtools are still detecting whenever the current page is using IMA.js or not.
 - **Reload** - you can see this state after enabling extension while the page is already loaded.
 As the name suggest, in order to use the devtools you need to reload the page so the 
 devtools code can be injected to page.
 - **Dead** - this state simply means that the devtools are enabled but you're actually on a pge
 that doesn't use IMA.js.
 - **Detected** - you can see results of this state in the image above. This means that the page
 you're currently visiting is using IMA.js and devtools are initialized. As a bonus you can also
 see the application `environment`, `language` and `version`. 

## Options

This is a separate page, where you can configure the script that is injected into the page
and customize it to your needs. As this is rather more complicated we're going to take
a deeper look into it in the [next section](/docs/devtools-options).
